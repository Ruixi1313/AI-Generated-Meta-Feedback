# Assignment: Sorting Algorithm (Individual)

>  **Before you start**
> - In section 1, describe your sorting task — what is the input and output?  
> - In section 2, explain how your algorithm sorts (your main idea or steps).  
> - In section 3, list test cases (normal, empty, reverse order, duplicates).  
> - In section 4, plan how you’ll improve your first version after testing.  
> - In section 5, think about possible mistakes (like off-by-one errors or wrong order).  

Fill out this plan **before you write your code** in `algorithm.py` or `PSEUDOCODE.md`.
